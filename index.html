In the upcoming March, he stumbles upon a magnificent discovery in the deep, scattered desert. Come join us on this journey as we explore the mysteries of 2024 together, right here on your screen.</p>

      <p class="scene-description">Once upon a time, a bird from Africa called the Hamerkop was exploring the Sahara Desert. It was searching for lunch, flying over the vast desert, when it noticed something unusual. Down by the edge of the desert, where it met the sea, a painted frogfish was locked in combat with a piranha. 
        Can you help the Hamerkop bird by guiding its gaze towards the fish so it can swoop down and catch it for lunch?

    <div class="scene-description">After eating the frogfish, the Hamerkop bird changed into a mythical creature with wings. Now, it wanted to fly from the desert to space to find a new home in the stars. Can you help it go up? Press gently to lift it, press harder to make it go faster.</div>

    <p class="scene-description" style="margin-top: 20px;">At last, the creature became a Zap and lived in sea space, filled with shooting stars from different universes. Surrounding this space were four planets: Red Octa, Blue Victa, Green Mucto, and Yellow Zecto. Each planet housed different kinds of Zaps, who ate flame, plasma, wind, or thunder based on where they lived. When Zaps passed these planets, they gave them energy to stay alive.
      Press random keys to change the mood of sea space.
      Tap the Zaps to make them camouflage.
      Sometimes loud voices scare them, but feel free to give it a try!
